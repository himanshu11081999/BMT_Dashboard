# BMT_Dashboard
BMT_Dashboard is an interactive data visualization tool built using R Shiny to monitor and analyze survival outcomes in bone marrow transplant (BMT) patients. It supports real-time insights into overall survival (OS), event-free survival (EFS), and cumulative incidence, stratified across key clinical dimensions.

# Features
Survival Analysis using Kaplan-Meier curves

Cumulative Incidence for transplant outcomes

5-Year Survival Trends visualized dynamically

Stratification by:

Disease type

Transplant type (e.g., matched sibling, unrelated donor, etc.)

Age group (adult vs pediatric)

Specific disease subgroups

# Outputs
Kaplan-Meier survival curves

Cumulative incidence plots

OS and EFS metrics for each category

Real-time visualization powered by Google Sheets (optional)

# Technologies Used
R / R Shiny for interactive UI and statistical analysis

Survival and Survminer R packages for survival analysis

ggplot2 for high-quality graphs

Google Sheets Integration (for real-time updates)

# Future Enhancement

Prediction models using Cox regression or ML

User authentication for clinical access control
